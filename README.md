# A one day crash course in C and C++

This repository contains the materials used for a one day crash course
in C and C++, given on 23-2-2017 at the School of Physics & Astronomy,
Monash University.

The core material is in the cccc2017.key (Keynote) and cccc2017.pdf
files. The exercises are separately presented in the exercises.tex and
exercises.pdf files.

Possible solutions are given in the solutions directory. The names os
the solutions files do not directly reflect the exercise number, but
should be straightforward to match. Some solutions are stored in their
own subdirectory.

Solutions will not be perfect. While tested, mistakes may remain, and
certainly programming styles and practices may differ to other
learning sources.
